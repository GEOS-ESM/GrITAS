    New scripts are created to run Conventional Aircraft data and the existing scripts are
    updated to take the new arguments.

    "gritas.f" is modified to accept 2 new arguments "-hdf -res RES", 
      where "-hdf"   will tag the output files with the tag "hdf" as MERRA needed and 
            "-res m" will grid the data in "540x361" horizontal grid.

     envfile.csh is updated to pass the RESolution to gritas as needed.

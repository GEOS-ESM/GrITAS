30Sep2022:
 - Todling: bring GrITAS to GIT - the contents of this directory were updated to CVS
            tag GrITAS-MERRA2_V2_SLES12 before placed into GIT - that seemed to be the
            latest tag for this directory and below. 
            NOTE: The gritas software (dir above) is however not in sync w/ the tag 
                  GrITAS-MERRA2_V2_SLES12; some merging and error checking would have
                  do be done to make sure the version of GrITAS brought in here works 
                  with that in the tag: GrITAS-MERRA2_V2_SLES12
MERRA2

  The following scritps to be used to process Conventional an d Satellite gridded (GrITAS) data.
   
   (Modifiy the scripts to represent the appropriate experiment, workiding and storage directories.)

     run_diag_gritas.csh
     run_sat_gritas.csh
     run_means.csh            (To compute Conventional monthly means.)

MERRA

The following executables are assumed to be in the directory when running scripts: GFIO_mean_r8.x gritas.x
  
ctl_file: directory containing the control files
rc_files: directory containing the resource files
old_files: directory containing
set_job: The main script for generating the statistics from conventional
         data.  Calls the script, diag2gritas2.csh
set_dsat_job.csh: The main script for generating the statistics from
                  satellite data. Calls the script run_dsat.csh
run_dsat.csh: Script for migrating archived input files and calling the
              script, dsat2gritas2.csh or dsat2gritas2_ods.csh
diag2gritas2.csh: Script for doing most of the processing of conventional
                  data including executing the gritas.x program (to generate
                  the 6-hourly files), compressing the data files and 
                  transfering the data files to the portal directory and 
                  calling the script gritas2means.csh (to compute the
                  monthly statistics)
dsat2gritas2.csh: Script for doing most of the processing of satellite
                  data including executing the gritas.x program (to generate
                  the monthly means), compressing the data files, and 
                  copying the data to the portal directory.
name_archfiles.csh: Script used to name input archived files. Called by
                    diag2gritas2.csh and run_dsat.csh
